<h1>Simulation of Industrial Process</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Simulations are invaluable in scenarios where industrial processes need to be optimized before deploying physical systems, minimizing downtime and resource expenditure. In this project, I leveraged ABB's RobotStudio simulation and offline programming software in combination with the RAPID programming language to simulate an industrial process using a six DOF robotic manipulator. The simulation encompassed various stages, including object modification, precise handling, and efficient packaging. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in programming robotic manipulators, understanding the intricacies of industrial automation, and appreciating the importance of simulation in refining processes for real-world applications.
